# Random Number Guessing Game

## Description

The `randomNumberGenerator` is a simple Java program that generates a random number and allows the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## Features

- Generates a random number.
- User input to guess the number.
- Provides feedback on the guessed number (too high, too low, or correct).
- Limited attempts for the user to guess the correct number.

## How to Play
- Run the program.
- Enter a random number to guess.
- You have a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
- The program will provide feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
- If you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts, you win. Otherwise, the game will notify you that you have exceeded your guesses

## Why This project

- If Statements:
  As a beginner, this project exposed me to the versatile use of if statements in programming. I learned how to structure conditional logic for decision-making in my code.

- Random Class:
  I gained insights into utilizing the Random class for generating random numbers. This feature added an element of unpredictability to the program, enhancing the user experience.

- Error Handling:
  The project taught me how to implement error handling mechanisms. I explored techniques for catching errors and personalizing error messages, improving the overall robustness of my code.

- Scanner Class:
  I delved into the usage of the Scanner class for interactive user input. This experience allowed me to create a more dynamic and engaging user interface for the random number guessing game.
